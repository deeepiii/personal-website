      <description>The Start of Something Good I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a love/hate relationship with social media, Twitter especially. Using it as a way to get news updates and keep an eye on topics I&amp;rsquo;m interested in was appealing to me. Using it to communicate and interact with others? Not so much. You could say I was a lot more invested in the &amp;ldquo;media&amp;rdquo; side of &amp;ldquo;social media&amp;rdquo;.
When I started making vocal synth music, it was as a fun, new project.</description>

      <title>Fly (ft. AVANNA)</title>

      <description>This is a song from the perspective of someone separated from their lover. Be it a short event or a more extended thing, it can be difficult to get through. I have a lot of respect for people in long-distance relationships. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I would be able to do that.
&amp;ldquo;Fly&amp;rdquo; was originally written for Harvest Avanna, a VOCALOID community event celebrating Avanna, a native English-speaking voicebank.</description>

      <description>A lot of my previous songs are happy and optimistic. That is partly as a reminder to me that things aren&amp;rsquo;t as bad as they seem. By contrast, &amp;ldquo;Trojan Horses&amp;rdquo; is a window into how mental illness can make you feel. Despite the tough subject matter, this song was fairly easy to write. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s easy to write about something that&amp;rsquo;s spent thousands of hours in your mind.</description>

      <description>Back in 2016 my brother was running a tabletop RPG for some friends. Since they all lived in different places and couldn&amp;rsquo;t meet in-person, they used an online tabletop instead. At the time, that service had a built-in music player you could use to loop music. He made all the graphics himself in the style of an early 90s fantasy RPG, so I wrote some similarly-styled songs for him to use in-game.</description>
