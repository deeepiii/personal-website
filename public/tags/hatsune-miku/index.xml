      <description>A lot of my previous songs are happy and optimistic. That is partly as a reminder to me that things aren&amp;rsquo;t as bad as they seem. By contrast, &amp;ldquo;Trojan Horses&amp;rdquo; is a window into how mental illness can make you feel. Despite the tough subject matter, this song was fairly easy to write. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s easy to write about something that&amp;rsquo;s spent thousands of hours in your mind.</description>

      <description>This song was my entry in the MIKU EXPO 2020 Song Contest. Anybody could use Hatsune Miku&amp;rsquo;s voice in an original song and enter it in this contest. The winner would have Miku perform their song live during the MIKU EXPO 2020 concert. I actually used the free trial for this song, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the VOCALOID editor yet. While my song didn&amp;rsquo;t win, I still received a lot of kind words from people that liked it.</description>
