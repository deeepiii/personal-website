      <description>It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise me if one of the first thing most new vocalsynth producers do when they buy the Kagamines is to make some sort of duet. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what I wanted to do. I always though the idea of 2 people, in different places, looking at the same thing in the sky was romantic. Couple that with the same 2 people trying to make sense of their feelings for each other, and you have &amp;ldquo;Sirius&amp;rdquo; in a nutshell.</description>
