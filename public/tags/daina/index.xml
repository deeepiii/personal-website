      <description>I wrote the chorus for this song in late 2019 or early 2020. Initially, wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how I wanted to handle the verses, so it sat unfinished for almost a year. The song was almost left unfinished, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the lyrics a whole lot. However, I shared them online and got positive feedback, so I stuck with it and finished the song.
Going in, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a plan for what &amp;ldquo;Maybe&amp;rdquo; would sound like.</description>
