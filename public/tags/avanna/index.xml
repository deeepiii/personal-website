      <description>This is a song from the perspective of someone separated from their lover. Be it a short event or a more extended thing, it can be difficult to get through. I have a lot of respect for people in long-distance relationships. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I would be able to do that.
&amp;ldquo;Fly&amp;rdquo; was originally written for Harvest Avanna, a VOCALOID community event celebrating Avanna, a native English-speaking voicebank.</description>
