This song was my entry in the MIKU EXPO 2020 Song Contest. Anybody could use Hatsune Miku's voice in an original song and enter it in this contest. The winner would have Miku perform their song live during the MIKU EXPO 2020 concert. I actually used the free trial for this song, as I didn't have the VOCALOID editor yet. While my song didn't win, I still received a lot of kind words from people that liked it.

"Citrus Sunset" was my first time using a voice synth other than Synthesizer V, and you can definitely tell. I'm very happy my tuning has improved since this song. Since there was a chance of having the song played live on stage, I decided to use more traditional sounding instruments and less synths. It certainly makes the song sound different from my previous work, especially the drums.
