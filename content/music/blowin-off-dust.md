Back in 2016 my brother was running [a tabletop RPG](https://paizo.com/pathfinder) for some friends. Since they all lived in different places and couldn't meet in-person, they used an online tabletop instead. At the time, that service had a built-in music player you could use to loop music. He made all the graphics himself in the style of an early 90s fantasy RPG, so I wrote some similarly-styled songs for him to use in-game. Unfortunately, the music player was removed from the service mid-campaign, so the players only heard a few of them.

All the songs were created between February and July 2016 using [LMMS](https://lmms.io/), a free, cross-platform DAW. To emulate the style of a 90s console, I used a few different plugins that emulate the sound chip inside the Sega Genesis (or Mega Drive, depending on where you're from).
