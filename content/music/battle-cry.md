This song means a little more to me than the others. I wrote it at a time where I was really struggling with some sin in my life. Eventually I reached a point where I was fed up. "Battle Cry" comes from my feelings as I cut ties with my old way of life and moved on to something better. I'm thankful to God for his mercy and grace, and I'm thankful to the other people in my life for their support.

As I was writing, it felt a lot like a "breakup song" to me, so I made use of some imagery and sounds related to texting. I also didn't use the old Sega Genesis drum samples and other FM instruments that I leaned toward before then, but went with something a little more modern.

(Fun fact: I recorded the texting sounds with a laptop and USB mic, stuffed in the driver's seat of my car, because it was the quietest place in the house at the time. The things you do when you don't have a studio...)
