This song is about a girl who has someone she likes, but is too shy to say anything to them. Instead of confessing her feelings, she writes them down in a notebook.

While ["Soaring"](/music/soaring/) was the first vocal synth song I released, "Pages" was actually written first. I sat on the lyrics for months, not really sure how I wanted it to sound. Eventually, I got tired of waiting and just dove in. (Maybe there's a lesson to be learned there...) Using what I learned from the first song and sticking to the 16-bit sounds I love, I sat down and finally got something my ears liked.
