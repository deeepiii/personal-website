The ["red string of fate"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_thread_of_fate) is the idea that two people who are destined to be together are connected by a red string. It's a popular idea often seen in Asian media, and being the anime fan that I am, I've run into it a few times. This song is about someone who has never found the person on the other end of their thread, but knows that one day they'll meet them.

Most of the music I've written is in 4/4, but "Red String of Fate" is an exception. Working in 3/4 is not something I'm used to doing, but it was a fun change of pace. In fact, the opening hook was originally written in 4/4, but I needed a hook for this song and, after adjusting it a bit to fit the time signature, it sounded pretty good.
