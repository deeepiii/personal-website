A lot of my previous songs are happy and optimistic. That is partly as a reminder to me that things aren't as bad as they seem. By contrast, "Trojan Horses" is a window into how mental illness can make you feel. Despite the tough subject matter, this song was fairly easy to write. I guess it's easy to write about something that's spent thousands of hours in your mind. In fact, "Trojan Horses" is, lyrically, my favorite song I've ever written.

Nearly all the sounds you hear in this song were generated with the [Vital synth](https://vital.audio/). This is an incredible piece of software than can do just about anything you'd want a synth to do. I am obviously not an expert in this kind of thing, but it really amazed me how many different sounds you could get out of this thing. Best of all, it's free.

Upon release, "Trojan Horses" was originally available on Spotify and Apple Music. However, for personal reasons, I decided to remove the song from those services. [You can read more about that here.](../../posts/why-i-left-social-media)
