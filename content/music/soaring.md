{{< youtube id="gSy-Ac8oxpk" title="Soaring ft. Eleanor Forte (SynthV Original Song)" >}}

I had the image in my head of someone daydreaming that they were flying with the one they have feelings for. They give them something to look forward to every day and lift them up when they're feeling down.

This song is the result of a lot of "firsts" for me. It's the first time working with vocal synthesis and the first time writing lyrics for anything. It's far from the best song out there, but you gotta take that first step at some point. Also, I am really glad [RhymeZone.com](https://rhymezone.com) exists because it is a newbie songwriter's best friend.
