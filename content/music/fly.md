{{< youtube id="Kro7SYLrEN8" title="Fly ft. Avanna (VOCALOID Original Song)" >}}

This is a song from the perspective of someone separated from their lover. Be it a short event or a more extended thing, it can be difficult to get through. I have a lot of respect for people in long-distance relationships. I don't know if I would be able to do that. 

"Fly" was originally written for [Harvest Avanna](https://twitter.com/harvestavanna), a VOCALOID community event celebrating Avanna, a native English-speaking voicebank. I really appreciate the managers originally choosing me as one of the producers for the 2021 event. Unfortunately, as things were ramping up and the date was getting closer, my mental health took a nosedive and working on personal projects was just not happening. I had a lot going on and the best course of action was to drop out of the project. At the time, I was in no position to work on either the song or the artwork, especially knowing the artwork would be a collaborative effort with another artist. It wouldn't have been fair to them if I wasn't at 100%. If you're interested, [I wrote something about all of that here.](../../posts/why-i-left-social-media) (Be warned, it's a long read.) That being said, as of the writing of this post, I'm doing a lot better and was able to finish the song and the visuals myself.

Avanna is advertised as a voice well-suited for folk music. While not exactly a folk song, "Fly" took a lot of inspiration from bluegrass, specifically Nickel Creek. [Their self-titled album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_Creek_(album)) is one of my favorite albums. It only seemed fitting to make a song in that style for Avanna to sing.

The video was created using [MikuMikuDance](https://learnmmd.com/what-is-mikumikudance/), a free 3D animation software originally released in 2007. It has a pretty big community of animators, modelers, and other developers, and it quite popular in the VOCALOID scene. The [Avanna model](https://www.deviantart.com/pikadude31451/art/Avanna-MMD-model-Download-V-4-0-618182825) was made by Pikadude31451 and the [autumn environment](https://www.deviantart.com/ketokeas/art/MMD-Autumn-Stage-541534381) by ketokeas. Lighting and other effects were handled with the Ray-MMD plugin.
