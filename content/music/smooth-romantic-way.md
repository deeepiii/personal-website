I've always liked songs that tell a story. When I started writing "Smooth Romantic Way", I wanted to tell the story of someone who wanted to confess their love to someone else, but things kept happening that prevented it. I think it turned out pretty funny.

This is the first song where I tried to use breath samples. Rather, I faked breath samples because the voice library for Eleanor Forte Lite doesn't have any. You can make a pretty convincing breath by using the `hh` phoneme and turning the Breathiness parameter all the way up. [I've made a tutorial video if you want to know more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMQIks2bz2E)
