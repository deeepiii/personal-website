{{< youtube id="ghE8A4OOShU" title="Maybe ft. DAINA (VOCALOID Original Song)" >}}

I wrote the chorus for this song in late 2019 or early 2020. Initially, wasn't sure how I wanted to handle the verses, so it sat unfinished for almost a year. The song was almost left unfinished, as I didn't really like the lyrics a whole lot. However, I shared them online and got positive feedback, so I stuck with it and finished the song.

Going in, I didn't have a plan for what "Maybe" would sound like. It ended up turning into an 80s-style power ballad. I'm a big fan of that style of music, so working on the song was pretty fun. Also, DAINA was incredibly difficult to work with. I need to practice tuning her more.
