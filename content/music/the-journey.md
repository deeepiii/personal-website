The latter half of 2019 into the first part of 2020 was a difficult time for me. I wrote "The Journey" as both a reminder to myself and a message to others that no matter what happens, everything is going to be fine. You may not know where you're going, but as long as you're moving, that's progress. Keep going! And, don't be afraid to get help. You're worth helping.

The cover art and lyric video for this song are inspired by the United States road signs. Since we're all going on a "journey", it seemed fitting to mimic what you see on the road.
