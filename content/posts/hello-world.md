> This is a blockquote. I'm not really sure what this will look like.

1. Item 1 of an ordered list
2. Item 2 of an ordered list
3. Item 3 of an ordered list

This is a piece of `inline code.`

This is a block of code:
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int number = 96;
    std::cout << "My favorite number is " << number << ".";
    return 0;
}
```

Horizontal rule!
